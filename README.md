Given the prototype status, the Jaipur Interactive Map intends to visualize ward-wise population and income data in Jaipur.
Using a set of unverified data presently, it enables the dynamic cursor radius-level exploration of areas. 
Once accurate data gets injected into it, marketers could analyze economic patterns to act location-based.

Approximation for Data is used since there is no official data regarding Jaipur using:
Jaipur Development Authority maps
2011 Census data
Google Earth/Maps (area estimation)
Property listings (Magicbricks, 99acres) for economic strata
